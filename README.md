Rocket Sim
==========

This is a simulation of the control of a rocket with 6 degrees of freedom.
The purpose of this was for me to challenge myself with programming the control algorithm. Therefore, everything else is quite barebones.

How to Control the Rocket
=========================
Set the target X, Y, Z co-ordinates (and roll angle in degrees) using the input fields in the top left corner. Press [Enter] to send them to the rocket.
Press [Space] to swap between the main camera and an onboard camera.
Press [Escape] to exit the simulation.
